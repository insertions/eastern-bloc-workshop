# Action!
This is the procedure we're proposing:

### Introduction - 5 min
1. What is the problem? Why is the relevant?

### Generating ideas - 25 min
2. Explain: How will we proceed?

  	- Adapted [6-3-5 Brainstorm]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-3-5_Brainwriting). Maybe a 8-3-4?

3. Follow the technique!

### Ideas selection - 40 min
4. Shift papers once again;

5. Read them ideas you have and select the two you personally like the best;

6. Time to choose! What are the requirements to select the final approach?
    - Needs to be feasible to implement during this workshop (eliminate the ones that seem hard to implement within the time frame we have);
    - Keep it simple!

7. Discussion & Voting!
    - Give voice to dissent;
    - Give people the freedom to do their own individual insertion if they want to (just follow the tutorials and Iâ€™ll try to help as I can);

### Making ideas concrete
Next workshop! ;)
