# Action!
This is the procedure we're proposing:

## Introduction - 5 min
1. What is the problem? Why is the relevant?

## Generating ideas - 25 min
2. Explain: How will we proceed?
  	- Adapted [6-3-5 Brainstorm]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-3-5_Brainwriting). Maybe 6-3-4;

3. Follow the technique!

## Ideas selection - 10 min
4. Shift papers once again;

5. Read them ideas you have and select the two you personally like the best;

## Conclusion - 5 minutes
6. Time to choose! What are the requirements to select the final approach?
    - Needs to be feasible to implement during this workshop (eliminate the ones that seem hard to implement within the time frame we have);
    - Keep it simple!

7. Discussion & Voting!
    - Give voice to dissent;
    - Give people the freedom to do their own individual insertion if they want to (just follow the tutorials and Iâ€™ll try to help as I can);

## Next workshop!
Organizing & Making ideas concrete ;)
